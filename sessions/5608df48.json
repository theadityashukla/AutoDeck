      "speaker_notes": "Let's explore the architecture behind AlphaFold's groundbreaking success. At its core, AlphaFold utilizes Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures, or JEPAs. Think of this as a way for the model to learn how the world works by predicting how things will behave. A crucial innovation is the incorporation of Isotropic Gaussian Regularization, or SIGReg. This acts like a guiding principle, forcing the model's internal representations to follow a specific, ideal distribution. This leads to remarkably stable training, even with very large models. The LeJEPA framework, a practical implementation of JEPAs, is incredibly efficient, scaling effectively across different models and datasets.  Finally, extensive testing proves LeJEPA's superiority, consistently outperforming existing methods, as demonstrated by its performance on benchmarks like ImageNet-1k and Galaxy10."
