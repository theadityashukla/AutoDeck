      "speaker_notes": "For decades, scientists have strived to accurately predict how proteins fold \u2013 a fundamental challenge in biology. The way a protein folds directly impacts its function, so understanding this process is key to drug discovery and countless other applications.  Historically, we\u2019re largely reliant on experimental techniques like X-ray crystallography and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. While powerful, these methods have significant drawbacks. X-ray crystallography demands that proteins form highly ordered crystals, a process that can be incredibly difficult, if not impossible, for many proteins. NMR, while not requiring crystals, faces limitations with protein size and the complexity of the resulting spectra. These approaches, despite their contributions, are slow, resource-intensive, and struggle with the scale and dynamism of modern biological research."
