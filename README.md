# AutoDeck

AutoDeck is an intelligent presentation generator that creates PowerPoint presentations using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) technology. The system processes scientific documents and generates structured, coherent presentations tailored to your specific needs.

## Work in Progress

This is a personal project currently under active development. The goal is to streamline the process of creating informative presentations from scientific documents while maintaining accuracy and relevance.

## Features Planned

- Structured input system for presentation requirements
- Scientific document parsing using GROBID
- Smart content retrieval using Vector DB
- LLM-powered content generation and organization
- PowerPoint generation with proper structure
- Support for templates and theming
- Citation management

## Current Status

- ✅ Initial architecture and pseudocode
- 🔄 GROBID parsing for text extraction
- 🔄 Extractor module to complement information extracted using the parser
- 🔄 Vector DB ingestion implementation
- 🔄 Integration into a RAG network; hopefully powered by GEMMA 3n
- 🔄 User interface design for input and document selection

## Future Enhancements

- Image and table handling
- Custom presentation templates
- Automated chart generation
- Citation formatting
- Multi-user support
